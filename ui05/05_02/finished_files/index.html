<article class="intro">
<p>Located in London&rsquo;s West End, the Landon  Hotel is at the heart of the city. The West End has something for everyone—from  theater to dining to historic sights. And the not-to-miss Rooftop Cafe is a  great place for travelers and locals to engage over drinks, food, and good  conversation. Far from being solely a tourist hotel, the West End Landon is an  important venue for the local community and meetings.</p>
